 This is my "Tic-Tac-Toe" project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game).

This project took me about 16 hours in total :-/ . Yeah, if that sounds ridiculous to you you're not alone. I spent about 2 hours for designing, and the other 14 hours creating it with HTML, CSS (less), and Javascript.

I started out this project with the intent of optimizing the UI for mobile devices, as most of my other projects look poor on mobile. Funny enough, this project looks okay on mobile, but slightly-off on desktops (the opposite of how things normally turn out.) This whole, "your site must look good on all screens" thing is turning out to be even harder than anticipated.

As always, any feedback is appreciated.
